I have changed something in notes.js and packages.json


1. notes.js (a4cb346) — edited two user-facing strings: "Usage: notes add <your note>" → "Usage: notes are add <your note>", and "Added note #..." → "Added a note #...".
2. package.json (e99f3ba) — changed the description field from "A tiny command-line notes tool..." → "A tiny-tiny command-line notes tool...".
3. notes.md (a0156e2) — new file, content: "I have changed something in notes.js and packages.json".

Flagging as likely unintended:
- "notes are add <your note>" reads as a grammar error — probably meant to stay "notes add <your note>". This is a usage/help string, so it'll confuse anyone running notes add with no args.
- "A tiny-tiny command-line notes tool" — the doubled "tiny-tiny" looks like a typo, not a deliberate rename.
- notes.md's content is a plain-text note-to-self ("I have changed something...") rather than actual documentation — looks like a placeholder/test file rather than something meant to ship.

None of these break functionality, but the wording changes look like accidental typos rather than intentional edits. Want me to revert the notes.js/package.json wording, or was that intentional (e.g., practice commits for a Git course)?
